I absolutely love it, and the first step in doing so is coding my own small scale blog CMS.</p>  <p>   As you can probably tell im kind of a&nbsp; &quot;designely challenged&quot; person if i can say so and because i can&#39;t afford buying a good blog design right now, i&#39;ve googled some free templates, filtered them out and chose this black - greenish one. I&#39;ve left the credits and the footer intact and i dont claim this as being my own concoction.</p>  <p>   As for the code itself, i&#39;ve focused just on the main functionality used LINQ2SQL  although last week , after going to a <a href=\\\"http://ronua.ro\\\">RONUA</a> conference , i&#39;ve learnead that MSF doesnt&nbsp;continue to develop&nbsp;Linq anymore just do only the bugfixing, instead going for <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO.NET_Entity_Framework\\\">Entity Framework </a>as their <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping\\\">ORM</a> implementation  and the basic CRUD operations in the backend Admin, and simple operation in the front end design.</p>  <p>   Im leaving all the jQuery goodness, efects and magic&nbsp; for as the last thing on the&nbsp; <a href=\\\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zce12xx2%28v=vs.80%29.aspx\\\">// TODO :</a> &nbsp;list.</p>",

		"Text": "Create a Selfexpanding Textarea using Javascript', 'http://www.alexpeta.ro/article/create-a-selfexpanding-textarea-using-javascript/', '<p>   This post today is about how to create a Facebook-like auto expanding textarea.</p>\n<p>   In order to solve this problem I looked to Facebook in order to somehow reversengineer it and failed gracefully, the javascript code there is pretty complex and out of my understanding and decided to start from scratch.</p>\n<p>   After creating a html textarea element and trying to make some simple calculus with character counting, i had noticed that fonts /characters differ from browser to browser. i.e. Lets say i have &nbsp;a &lt;span&gt; element , font family Arial, 12px size, they are 2 diffrent actual pixel sizes in Firefox vs IE.</p>\n<p>   As the &lt;textarea&gt; element doesnt self-expand, the question I&#39;ve asked myself was : what html tag element is self exapading vertically when filled with text ? Why not have the text fill a &lt;div&gt; element and transfer its size to the &lt;textarea&gt; ?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>   So lets get started with the code, first we have the some CSS :</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n.big_wrap{\n  background-color: #EDEFF4;\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #E5EAF1;\n  margin-top: 2px;\n  padding: 5px 5px 4px;\n}\n.fontStyle{\n  direction: ltr;\n  font-family: &quot;lucida grande&quot;,tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif;\n  font-size: 11px;\n  text-align: left;\n}\n#Test{\n  left:-9999px;\n  position: absolute;\n  height: auto;\n  width: auto;\n  font-family: &quot;lucida grande&quot;,tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif;\n  font-size: 11px;\n}\n#comm{\n  width:340px;\n  border:1px solid #BDC7D8;\n  height:13px;\n  padding:3px;\n  overflow:hidden;\n  resize: none;\n  word-wrap: break-word;\n  white-space: pre-wrap;\n  z-index:2;\n}\n.btn {\n  background-color: #5B74A8;\n  border: 0 none;\n  color: White;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  display: block;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  padding: 3px 8px;\n}\n#highlighter{\n  width:340px;\n  white-space: pre-wrap;\n  word-wrap: break-word;\n  position:absolute;\n  color:trasparent;\n  z-index:1;\n  border:1px solid #003;\n  visibility:hidden;\n  padding:3px;\n  margin:1px;\n}\n</pre>\n<p>   Here we have defied some styles to resemble the facebook interface.</p>\n<p>   Next is the HTML :</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n\t  &lt;td&gt;\n\t    &lt;div style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;fontStyle&quot; id=&quot;highlighter&quot; name=&quot;highlighter&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\t&lt;div class=&quot;big_wrap&quot;&gt;\n\t\t  &lt;div class=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt;\n\t\t    &lt;textarea id=&quot;comm&quot; class=&quot;fontStyle&quot;  onkeypress=&quot;enlarge(this,event)&quot; onkeyup=&quot;enlarge(this,event)&quot; onkeydown=&quot;enlarge(this,event)&quot; onblur=&quot;enlarge(this,event)&quot; onfocus=&quot;enlarge(this,event)&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;input class=&quot;mentionsHidden&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; name=&quot;add_comment_text&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; \n\t\t &lt;/div&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;/td&gt;\n\t&lt;/tr&gt;\n\t&lt;tr&gt;\n\t   &lt;td style=&quot;height:20px;padding-top:2px;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n\t\t &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn&quot; id=&quot;btnAddComm&quot; value=&quot;Add Comment&quot; name=&quot;btnAddComm&quot;&gt;\n\t   &lt;/td&gt;\n\t&lt;/tr&gt; \n\t&lt;tr&gt;\n\t  &lt;td style=&quot;height:20px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;\n\t&lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;  \n</pre>     <p>   And finally the Javascript code :</p>\n<p>   &nbsp;</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\nfunction enlarge(c,e){\n  if(c.value.length == 0){\n    document.getElementById(&#39;highlighter&#39;).innerHTML = &#39;&#39;;\n\tc.style.height == &#39;13px&#39;;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    document.getElementsByName(&#39;add_comment_text&#39;).item(0).value = c.value;\n\tdocument.getElementById(&#39;highlighter&#39;).innerHTML = c.value;\n\tvar h = document.getElementById(&#39;highlighter&#39;).clientHeight-6;\n\tc.style.height = h+&#39;px&#39;;\n  }\n}\n</pre>  <p>   So what i have created here is my &lt;textarea&gt; element with the id comm, which i have binded with keypress/keydown/keyup/onblur/onfocus events to call the enlarge function.</p>  <p>   The function will put the textarea content in our &quot;highlighter&quot; div, which as you noticed must have the same width /style definition as the textarea, and the get the height of the highlighter and send it to the textarea.</p>",

		"Text": "<p>   Wanted to&nbsp;blog for some time now about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodybuilding\">Bodybuilding</a>, and i finally got some time and inspiration.</p>  <p>   Since i have been a kid i&#39;ve allways practiced a sport. I think its the one of the most important things that my parents encuranged me to practice.</p>  <p>   First it was footbal (soccer) playing with the neighbour&#39;s kinds around the neighbourhood. I must admit, i wasn&#39;t too good at it but the idea is that everytime i heard my voice yealled at the yard door, i allways looked forward to just go around and have fun.</p>  <p>   After&nbsp;a couple of years in junior high i started playing Basketball and it stuck with me all through highschool and a little in my first year of College.</p>  <p>   *I love this game.*</p>  <div>   <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/HPiaoPCtkXk\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>  <p>   Beeing in College in <a href=\"http://binged.it/rNGNdK\">Bucharest</a>, i didn&#39;t&nbsp; have time to go anymore to hit the basketball field, nor were the my old friends allways available for a match, so at this point&nbsp; i had to do something else and &nbsp;then came the answer : go to the gym.</p>  <p>   When i first stepped foot in a&nbsp; gym i was weighing about 60KG (130punds for all you non-metric people) 180, eathing one meal , two the most&nbsp; per day, could even do a flat Bench Press with no weights.</p>  <p>   <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bodybuilding+metrorex&amp;oq=bodybuilding+metrorex&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=597l4044l0l4186l23l19l1l9l10l0l211l1180l2.6.1l9l0\">It was a underground gym</a>, located in a huge empty room at a<a href=\"http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lujerului_(sta%C8%9Bie_de_metrou)\"> subway station </a>near where i was living at that time. I&#39;ve later learned that this is the place where the guys that go to bodybuilding competitions were training.</p>  <p>   The first days / weeks were awkword, i didnt knew anything, i just moved the weights around trying to mimic the other bulked up guys there.</p>  <p>   It was hard, really hard trying to integrate gym after work,but after i&#39;ve noticed that my body was begining to transform, i was hooked.</p>  <p>   There is a lot of motivational material out there and a lot of views on how you should be motivated to &quot;go hard or go home&quot;.&nbsp;</p>  <p>   I personally think of bodybuilding and sports in general as something long term with a&nbsp;lifetime span&nbsp;mentality. I am setting milestones, objectives , short term goals and i push myself to reach them but they are positioned . I think you can apply this in any aspect of your life and it will surely keep you focused and on track.</p>  <p>   Stay focused, train hard, set goals, set milestones and have fun. The results will come and trust me, you will be hooked.</p>",
